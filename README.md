# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning (ML) Projects** repository! ðŸš€ Here, I will be uploading some **easy and fast ML projects** using both **Python** and **R**. These projects are designed to be simple, yet effective, showcasing different ML techniques and algorithms.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **Notebooks (.ipynb)**: Each notebook contains a self-contained ML project, covering different models and techniques.
- **DATA Folder**: This folder includes the **CSV files and datasets** used in these projects. Feel free to use them for your own experimentation!

## ðŸ“Œ Projects Included
### ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models
- **Bayesian Network (R)**: A probabilistic graphical model representing a set of variables and their conditional dependencies.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier (R)**: A simple yet powerful algorithm for classification tasks based on Bayes' theorem.
- **LSTM (Python)**: A sophisticated RNN used for time-series analysis and forecasting.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To get started with these projects:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlexCasasVivas/ML.git
